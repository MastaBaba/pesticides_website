# INSTALL

## Build

The website files are located in the [`docs/`](https://github.com/severo/pesticides_website/tree/master/docs) directory.

They must not be edited directly. Instead, modify the sources in the [`src/`](https://github.com/severo/pesticides_website/tree/master/src) directory, and then build the website files with:

```bash
npm run-script build
```

## Deployment

The [GitHub repository](https://github.com/severo/pesticides_website/) is configured to automatically deploy the website to https://severo.github.io/pesticides_website/ on every new commit on the [master branch](https://github.com/severo/pesticides_website/tree/master).

The website files come from the [`/docs`](https://github.com/severo/pesticides_website/tree/master/docs) directory.
