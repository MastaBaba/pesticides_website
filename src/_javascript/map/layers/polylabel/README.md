# README

I just made a dirty copy/paste from:

- https://github.com/mapbox/polylabel/blob/23f6a762ef2873519b86d46b625dd80f340e3dc3/polylabel.js

and adapted it to be an ES module.

TODO: propose a Pull Request to this project, in order to be able to import it
as an ES module. See how it has been done in
https://www.npmjs.com/package/tinyqueue, for example.
